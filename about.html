<p>Hi! My name is Liam Haggerty. I am a student at Marist College studying computer science with a minor in cybersecurity. Some of my hobbies include watching movies, boxing, martial arts, hiking, and tinkering with my motorcycle.</p>

<p>I also love anything outdoors and frequently visit Lake Placid, NY in the Adirondaks.</p>
