Here, we are going into the basics of bootstrap. I have used bootstrap before, however this was a further in depth representation of what it is. What it does is give you an example website.</p>

<p>Then using the source code, you can customize it and change the website to how you would like it. I used it to show some stuff about me and I added some pictures. You can see the wesbite on github pages <a href="https://liamhaggerty1.github.io/lab-2-bootstrap/">here</p>

<!-- <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>

<p>This essentially entailed getting used to what github looks like. One new thing I learned was how to use github pages.</p>

<p>This is a specific link that will lead to your code that is in your repo. That leads me into my other point. HTML & CSS.</p>

    Above is a sample html script that shows most of what we were introduced to in this lesson. We also learned how to "style" your webpage to make it pop.</p>

Lesson 3. In this, we learned about using bootstrap.</p>

<p>Bootstrap is essentially a css template where you can download a css file for free and modify it to your liking to style a beautiful website.</p>

<p>We also learned about different frameworks and what they actually are and what they do. Like bootstrap, a framework is a pre-written file that provides code to the end user.</p>
